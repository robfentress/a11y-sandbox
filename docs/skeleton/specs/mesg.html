    <p>You are cordially invited to this week's Digital Accessibility Brown Bag Lunch.</p>
    <h2>About the Brown Bag</h2>
    <p>Bring your lunch and whatever you’ve been working on that has been challenging from
    an accessibility perspective or that you’d just like to get some feedback on. We’ll help you check it with
    accessibility testing tools and assistive technologies like screen readers, and we’ll all work together to come up
    with solutions to any problems encountered. If you’re having trouble with something, it’s likely someone else is too
    and may have the answers you need!</p>
    <p>The Brown Bag is a recurring meeting, every Friday from Noon - 1pm in
    1120 Torgersen Hall and online via the university's
    conferencing tool, <a href="https://virginiatech.zoom.us/j/100287242" target="_blank">Zoom</a>. At the end of each session, we’ll agree on a topic to research for the following week and
    start off that week’s session with a brief review of what we’ve learned.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>This Week's Conversation Starter</h2>
    <p>This week, we'll continue to explore some web pages from peer institutions of Virginia Tech to see how we compare in terms of accessibility.  In particular, we'll look at Penn State's site, which should be interesting, since, as a result of an Office of Civil Rights complaint from a blind student back in 2010, they entered into a settlement agreement that required them to audit and remediate their electronic and information technology.
