1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,612


2
00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:03,570
PRESENTER 1: All right.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,720
Since we're standing here
in front of the elevator,

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,950
let's talk about accessibility.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,350
PRESENTER 2: Those buttons
have Braille notation on them.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,500
PRESENTER 1: And the bell rings
as each floor's number lights

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,132
up.

8
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:14,840
PRESENTER 2: And the
door is really wide,

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,547
well, usually it is.

10
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:18,380
PRESENTER 1: Elevators
are pretty accessible

11
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,840
and that's because accessibility
is important for everyone

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,644
whether they
recognize it or not.

13
00:00:22,644 --> 00:00:25,060
PRESENTER 3: Maybe you wear
glasses to improve your vision

14
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,250
or maybe you use
left-handed scissors.

15
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,040
PRESENTER 2: Or maybe that
bum knee makes you walk up

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,465
the ramp instead of the stairs.

17
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,090
PRESENTER 1: Or maybe
you're colorblind

18
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,180
and rely on the arrangement
of the lights rather

19
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,382
than the colors.

20
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:39,722
PRESENTER 3: Whatever your
particular need, the web,

21
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:41,430
like a good elevator,
should be something

22
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,850
you could navigate with ease.

23
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,516
PRESENTER 1: We're
here to offer insight

24
00:00:44,516 --> 00:00:47,140
into the most common
issues faced by web users.

25
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,544
PRESENTER 2: We want to make
accessible content for all.

26
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:51,710
PRESENTER 3: If you care
about your content reaching

27
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,700
all learners, you must
care about accessibility.

28
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,330
