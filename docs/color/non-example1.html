    <h1>Assignments</h1>
    <h2>Being Late Affects Grades</h2>
    <div id="figure"><img style="width: 100%;" src="../resources/images/homework.jpg" alt="a cup of coffee beside an open notebook with a pen on it in front of some books" />
        <div id="reminder">Drink some coffee. It might help.</div>
    </div>
    <p>As you can see from the chart, some folks are having trouble getting their assignments in on time and it is really affecting their grade.&nbsp; Make sure to pay attention to due dates!</p>
