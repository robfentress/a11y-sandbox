    <h3><a href="https://w3c.github.io/coga/design/#user-testing-does-the-understand-what-ui-elements-their-purpose-and-utility">2.1 User testing - Does the understand what UI elements, their purpose, and utility?</a></h3>
    <p>Make sure your user testing has all the different cognitive disabilities represented. (Make sure people don't just ask these as questions, but ask something that demonstrates it.)</p>
    <p>Test for the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does the user know what the page is about (frame to make sure people don't just ask these as questions, but ask something that demonstrates it.)
        </li>
        <li>Does the user know what actions they can take on a page
        </li>
        <li>Does the user know where they are in a website, an application or a multistep process
        </li>
        <li>Can the user easily find the different sections of content
        </li>
        <li>Identify the different activities that the user may want to complete on the page.
            <ul>
                <li>Can they achieve the activities without asking for help
                </li>
                <li>Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities
                </li>
                <li>Does they user find them easy to achieve
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    <p>Make sure your user testing has all the different cognitive disabilities represented. Test for the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can they easily fill in the form without making mistakes?
        </li>
        <li>Was it pleasant to fill out the form? How is their mood changed?
        </li>
        <li>Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or tiered?
        </li>
        <li>Ask the user if anything was hard.
        </li>
        <li>Ask the user how the form could be easier to fill out. Suggest some of the relevant design techniques bellow and ask if it would help them with this form

    <p>Identify the different tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can they achieve the activities easily without losing focus?
        </li>
        <li>Distract the user for a minute so that they lose focus. Can they get easily back to the task?
        </li>
        <li>Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or tiered
