    <p>You are cordially invited to this week's Digital Accessibility Brown Bag Lunch.</p>    <strong>About the Brown
    Bag</strong>
    <p>Bring your lunch and whatever you’ve been working on that has been challenging from an accessibility perspective
        or that you’d just like to get some feedback on. We’ll help you check it with accessibility testing tools and
        assistive technologies like screen readers, and we’ll all work together to come up with solutions to any
        problems encountered. If you’re having trouble with something, it’s likely someone else is too and may have the
        answers you need!</p>
    <p>The Brown Bag is a recurring meeting, every Friday from Noon - 1pm in 1120 Torgersen Hall and online via the
        university's conferencing tool,
        <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fvirginiatech.zoom.us%2Fj%2F100287242&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1536093537751000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkox8GAyamB3Jer_xgSV85o6Sb4g" target="_blank">Zoom</a>.
        At the end of each session, we’ll agree on a topic to research for the following week and start off that week’s
        session with a brief review of what we’ve learned.&nbsp;</p>    <strong>This Week's Conversation
    Starter</strong>
    <p>This week, we'll talk about different options for getting accredited as an accessibility professional, in particular the certifications associated with the <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/">International Association of Accessibility Professionals</a> and the <a href="https://www.section508.gov/test/trusted-tester">Trusted Tester</a> program.  Would such certifications and the accompanying professional development associated with them be of interest to you?  What kind of support could you get from your managers for this? Would this provide a useful common reference for knowing what the the right choices to make regarding accessibility are?</p>    <strong>How to
