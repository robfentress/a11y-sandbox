        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage authors, who are using technologies
            which are capable of achieving their desired default visual presentation, to enable
            people who require a particular visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the
            text presentation as needed. This includes people who require the text in a particular
            font size, foreground and background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.

        </p>
        <p>If an author can use text to achieve the same visual effect, he or she should present
            the information as text rather than using an image. If for any reason, the author
            cannot format the text to get the same effect, the effect won't be reliably presented
            on the commonly available user agents, or using a technology to meet this criterion
            would interfere with meeting other criteria such as 1.4.4, then an image of text can
            be used. This includes instances where a particular presentation of text is essential
            to the information being conveyed, such as type samples, logotypes, branding, etc.
            Images of text may also be used in order to use a particular font that is either not
            widely deployed or which the author doesn't have the right to redistribute, or to
            ensure that the text would be anti-aliased on all user agents.

        <p>Images of text can also be used where it is possible for users to customize the image
            of text to match their requirements.

        </p>
        <p>The definition of image of text contains the note: Note: This does not include text
            that is part of a picture that contains significant
            other visual content. Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams
            which visually
            convey important information through more than just text.

        <p>Techniques for satisfying this Success Criterion are the same as those for Success
            Criterion 1.4.9, except that they only need to apply if the visual presentation can

        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage authors, who are using technologies
            which are capable of achieving their desired default visual presentation, to enable
            people who require a particular visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the
            text presentation as needed. This includes people who require the text in a particular
            font size, foreground and background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.

        </p>
        <p>If an author can use text to achieve the same visual effect, he or she should present
            the information as text rather than using an image. If for any reason, the author
            cannot format the text to get the same effect, the effect won't be reliably presented
            on the commonly available user agents, or using a technology to meet this criterion
            would interfere with meeting other criteria such as 1.4.4, then an image of text can
            be used. This includes instances where a particular presentation of text is essential
            to the information being conveyed, such as type samples, logotypes, branding, etc.
            Images of text may also be used in order to use a particular font that is either not
            widely deployed or which the author doesn't have the right to redistribute, or to
            ensure that the text would be anti-aliased on all user agents.

        </p>
        <p>Images of text can also be used where it is possible for users to customize the image
            of text to match their requirements.

        </p>
        <p>The definition of image of text contains the note: Note: This does not include text
            that is part of a picture that contains significant
            other visual content. Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams
            which visually
            convey important information through more than just text.

        </p>
        <p>Techniques for satisfying this Success Criterion are the same as those for Success
            Criterion 1.4.9, except that they only need to apply if the visual presentation can
            be achieved with the technologies that the author is using. For Success Criterion
            1.4.9, the sufficient techniques would be applied only when the user can customize
            the output.
