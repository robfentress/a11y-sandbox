It's possible that adding aria-disabled here may also provide a useful cue, but it may also cause the link not to receive focus, which may be weird. Maybe just using # as the value of href and intercepting the click, so it doesn't scroll the view would be best. Or perhaps just not use an anchor tag at all.
