                    <p>So, here I see that the screen reader for iOS is VoiceOver, which is found in the Accessibility settings.</p>

                    <p>While a well-structured table makes it easier for sighted users to find the information they need, it is even more useful for people who are blind or low vision who might actually be using screen reading software, because without proper
                        structure it is much easier for them to lose their place in the data.</p>

                    <p>Let me demonstrate by using the macOS screen reader VoiceOver, to navigate the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The first thing VoiceOver will do upon loading is to read the page title.</p>

                    <p>In this case, it knew because I had used the tools available to me in Canvas's rich content editor to make the table and to indicate what cells I wanted to serve as row and column headers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>When a screen reader user encounters this version of the table, they will be told they are in a table and what its name is, and also how many rows and columns are in the table.&nbsp; They will even be able to navigate vertically and
                        horizontally between cells instead of having to read through it line by line in order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>However, even though this table looks just like the first one I demoed for you, there is one important difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>In this version of the table, if I use a screen reader to navigate from cell to cell, it won't tell me the header name whenever I enter a new column or row.&nbsp; If you'll recall, this was very useful information in helping me find
                        the information I was looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Why won't it announce the header name?&nbsp; It sure looks like there are row and column headers.&nbsp; But looks can be deceiving. In this table, I only changed the appearance of the cells that were to serve as headers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>For instance, if we select the text, we can see that I bolded and centered things in those cells and changed the text and background colors.&nbsp; However, I didn't indicate programmatically that they were serving that function in
                        a way that a screen reader could use to provide those cues.</p>

                    <p>So, how would I do that?</p>

                    <p>It's easy, you just select the cells that you want to serve as your headers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
